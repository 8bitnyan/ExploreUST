Design a set of animated icon buttons with smooth scaling interaction. Each button includes an icon and optional label, wrapped in a tappable area. When selected or tapped, the button should scale up (e.g., to 1.2Ã—) using a springy animation like elasticOut. Icons should change to a highlighted theme color when active, and stay gray when inactive. Each button has internal padding, rounded corners, and a modern, clean aesthetic. The layout should support equal spacing between buttons and work well in navigation bars or toolbars. Use subtle hover/tap feedback and make the design mobile-friendly.
